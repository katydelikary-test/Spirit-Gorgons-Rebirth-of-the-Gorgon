Veil of Protection","description":"On the same quiet riverbank, the Gorgons stands shrouded in a flowing black mantle, her arms extended forward as if to halt an unseen force. Her presence is both commanding and protective, like a guardian between worlds. The fabric moves in the breeze, while the water reflects her stance, amplifying the sense of an invisible boundary. Part of the “Spirit Gorgona /Rebirth of the Gorgon” series, this piece embodies the archetype of the sentinel — fierce, mystical, and unyielding.","external_url":"https://www.instagram.com/k_dancekary/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Series","value":"Rebirth of the Gorgon"},{"trait_type":"Scene","value":"Riverbank"},{"trait_type":"Pose","value":"Arms forward"},{"trait_type":"Mantle Color","value":"Black"},{"trait_type":"Mood","value":"Protective"},{"trait_type":"Symbolism","value":"Guardian Between Worlds"}]}
