Ritual of the Skybound Gorgon","description":"On the sacred sands, the Gorgon rises in dance — her arms lifted to the unseen heavens, summoning winds and whispering to the spirits.\nAbove her, a lone bird circles, carrying the prayers into the endless sky.\nThis moment is a living ritual — a meeting of earth, air, and myth.\nEach movement seals the spell, weaving freedom, transformation, and divine protection.\n \nThis is not just an NFT. This is a one-of-one original performance, created, danced, and imagined solely by the artist.\nOnly one collector will own this rare piece — a true myth brought to life.","external_url":"https://www.instagram.com/k_dancekary/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Setting","value":"Sacred Shore"},{"trait_type":"Ritual Element","value":"Flight Invocation"},{"trait_type":"Sky Symbol","value":"Sky Symbol"},{"trait_type":"Energy","value":"Ascension"},{"trait_type":"Motion","value":"Wind Dance"},{"trait_type":"Myth Power","value":"Freedom Seal"}]}
