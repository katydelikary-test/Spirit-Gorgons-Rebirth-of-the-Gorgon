Steps Between Worlds","description":"Shadows cradle her face as she gazes upward through the veil of a black mantle — the silent breath before transformation.\nFrom the forgotten stone staircase of an abandoned building, she descends like a memory reborn, each step pulling her deeper into the forest’s hidden myth.\nThis is not just movement — it is the Gorgon’s return, her rebirth into the realm between ruins and nature.\n\n\uD83D\uDC8E Authenticity:\nEvery Spirit Gorgons NFT is an authentic performance art piece — imagined, performed, and captured entirely by the artist.\nNo stock media. No borrowed visuals. No AI mimicry.\nOnly original choreography, concept, and myth brought to life in motion.\n\nCollection: Spirit Gorgons — \"Rebirth of the Gorgon\"\nAn expansive and evolving collection of unique NFT artworks inspired by mythological archetypes, dance, and ritual.\nEach piece is an original creation — blending movement, symbolism, and storytelling to bring ancient myths into the digital realm.\nNew series and themed sets will be added regularly, expanding the world of \"Rebirth of the Gorgon \" and offering collectors fresh, immersive experiences.","external_url":"https://www.instagram.com/k_dancekary/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Setting","value":"Abandoned Staircase"},{"trait_type":"Mood","value":"Awakening"},{"trait_type":"Veil Color","value":"Black"},{"trait_type":"Movement Style","value":"Improvisation"},{"trait_type":"Myth Archetype","value":"Gorgon"},{"trait_type":"Element","value":"Earth & Shadow"},{"trait_type":"Season","value":"Autumn"},{"trait_type":"Rarity","value":"Rare"}]}
