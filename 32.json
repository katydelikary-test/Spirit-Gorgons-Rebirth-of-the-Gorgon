River Sentinel","description":"A mystical female silhouette in a black mantle stands on the quiet riverbank, arms spread wide like wings. Her still pose evokes the presence of an ancient statue, while a gentle wind stirs the fabric, giving the figure a subtle sense of motion. The water mirrors her form, creating the aura of a dual world — both material and mythical. This NFT is part of the “Spirit Gorgona / Rebirth of the Gorgon” series, exploring myth, movement, and the power of the feminine archetype.","external_url":"https://www.instagram.com/k_dancekary/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Series","value":"Rebirth of the Gorgon"},{"trait_type":"Scene","value":"Riverbank"},{"trait_type":"Pose","value":"Arms spread"},{"trait_type":"Mantle Color","value":"Black"},{"trait_type":"Mood","value":"Mystical"},{"trait_type":"Symbolism","value":"Dual Worlds"}]}
